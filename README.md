# 👨‍🏫 Tech-Educators-Demo-Chatbot

This chatbot was built as a small personal project to demonstrate my interest in Tech Educators, my enthusiasm for learning, and my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am learning to build chatbots.


## ⭐ Why I Built This Project

I was recently invited to an interview with Tech Educators, and I wanted to take the opportunity to show my genuine interest and enthusiasm for the company. Being given this chance meant a lot to me, so I decided to build this small chatbot project as a practical way to demonstrate my curiosity, my willingness to learn, and my excitement about what Tech Educators does. I chose this project because it allowed me to apply and grow my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while creating something relevant, interactive, and aligned with the organisation’s mission. I really enjoyed building it, and it motivated me even more to continue learning and exploring how technology can support education.

## 🎯 Why I Chose to Build a Chatbot

I chose a chatbot for a few reasons:

1. It relates directly to teaching and communication

Tech Educators focuses on supporting learners and helping people access tech.
A chatbot felt like a natural way to show how technology can support learning, answer questions, and improve user experience.

2. It’s a great way to show real, practical JavaScript skills

This project demonstrates:

- DOM manipulation

- event handling (click, keypress, toggling visibility)

- basic logic and branching

- dynamic UI updates

- accessibility considerations

- clean, readable code organization

3. It was fun and motivating

I genuinely enjoyed the process—building the UI, writing the response logic, and testing the interactions.
It also helped me understand how chat flows work before moving on to more advanced features like OpenAI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML 

- CSS 

- JavaScript 

## Key Features

- Click on the chat icon to start

- Basic accessibility (keyboard support)

- User and bot message display

- Hard-coded bot responses for common Tech Educators queries

- Auto-scrolling message container

- Clean helper functions (e.g., appendMessage)

- Lightweight, no frameworks needed

## 🚀 Future Improvements

I built this as a foundation for something more powerful.

Here’s what I plan to add next:

1. OpenAI API integration

- I want to replace the hard-coded responses with live AI-powered replies.
- I didn’t include my OpenAI credentials in this version because:

- I’m still experimenting with OpenAI chatbot workflows

- I don’t want to push API keys to GitHub

- I’m exploring secure environment setups first

2. Contextual memory / improved conversation flow

Better handling of follow-up questions and user intent.

3. UI enhancements

typing indicator

smoother animations

message timestamps

4. More accessibility improvements

- ARIA roles

- focus management

- better screen reader support

## 🎓 Why This Project Matters to Me

I built this not just to show code, but to show:

- my passion for the tech industry

- my excitement to keep learning and improving

#### Working on this confirmed why I want to be involved in tech education:
I enjoy understanding problems, building solutions, and sharing what I learn.
